### Notes for Understanding

#### **1. APIs and Microservices**
- APIs act as bridges between applications, enabling communication.
- Microservices are independent units that interact through APIs.
- **Security Tips**:
  - Use service meshes for communication management.
  - Enforce strict coding standards and secure authentication mechanisms.
  - Provide minimal error details to avoid helping attackers.
  - Allow only necessary HTTP methods to reduce attack risks.

#### **2. Online Storage**
- Classify data based on sensitivity for proper security measures.
- Add security layers like monitoring and alerts for unauthorized changes.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong passwords.

#### **3. Containers and Orchestration**
- Containers are lightweight and more efficient than VMs.
- Orchestration tools manage multiple containers automatically.
- Avoid running containers with admin privileges to reduce risks.
- Use trusted container images to prevent vulnerabilities.

#### **4. Serverless Computing**
- Serverless systems run code on-demand, reducing attack surfaces.
- API gateways enforce access control and usage limits.
- Always authenticate and authorize before inter-service communication.

#### **5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- IaC uses scripts to automate infrastructure deployment.
- Enhances security by eliminating manual configuration errors.
- Immutable infrastructure reduces risks by replacing old systems with new ones.

### Simplified Explanations:

#### **Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository, ensuring smaller, manageable changes to reduce risks and conflicts.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automates testing and deployment processes, making code integration and release faster, consistent, and high quality.

#### **Dev(Sec)Ops**
- DevOps is a way of working that combines development and operations to build software efficiently.  
- Security is added seamlessly (DevSecOps) by avoiding delays, reducing errors, and ensuring rapid feedback between teams.  

#### **Cloud Computing**
- Cloud computing provides services like storage, tools, and infrastructure whenever needed, with no need for users to manage hardware directly.  
- It includes advantages like auto-scaling but requires careful planning to control unexpected costs, like during attacks.

#### **Cloud Native**
- These are modern systems built to fully utilize cloud capabilities, such as automation and integration.  
- Key technologies include CI/CD, microservices, and containers. Without proper security, they can become easy targets for attackers.

#### **Cloud Native Security**
- Focuses on principles like zero trust (assume breaches happen) and secure defaults.  
- Features include monitoring, logging, and identity-based access controls to ensure proactive security.

#### **Cloud Workflows**
- Automated processes that are triggered by events (e.g., login attempts).  
- They run pre-defined actions and require thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### **Modern Tooling**
- Tools improve application security during development (e.g., SAST/DAST for scanning vulnerabilities).  
- They integrate into CI/CD pipelines, reduce manual effort, and provide centralized dashboards for better visibility.

#### **Application Inventory Tools**
- These tools find and list all software, APIs, and cloud apps in a system, ensuring the inventory stays complete and up-to-date.

#### **Least Privilege and Policy Automation**
- Automates the enforcement of policies, like only allowing necessary permissions (least privilege).  
- Includes monitoring for violations, enforcing secure communication, and requiring MFA for critical accounts.

#### **Modern Tactics**
- Use asynchronous pipelines for security tests to avoid slowing down development.  
- Convert test results into actionable items like unit tests and build secure code libraries for developers.  
- Stay updated with industry practices by learning from leaders and conferences.
