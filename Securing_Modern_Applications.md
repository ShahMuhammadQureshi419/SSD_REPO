### Notes for Understanding

#### **1. APIs and Microservices**
- APIs act as bridges between applications, enabling communication.
- Microservices are independent units that interact through APIs.
- **Security Tips**:
  - Use service meshes for communication management.
  - Enforce strict coding standards and secure authentication mechanisms.
  - Provide minimal error details to avoid helping attackers.
  - Allow only necessary HTTP methods to reduce attack risks.

#### **2. Online Storage**
- Classify data based on sensitivity for proper security measures.
- Add security layers like monitoring and alerts for unauthorized changes.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong passwords.

#### **3. Containers and Orchestration**
- Containers are lightweight and more efficient than VMs.
- Orchestration tools manage multiple containers automatically.
- Avoid running containers with admin privileges to reduce risks.
- Use trusted container images to prevent vulnerabilities.

#### **4. Serverless Computing**
- Serverless systems run code on-demand, reducing attack surfaces.
- API gateways enforce access control and usage limits.
- Always authenticate and authorize before inter-service communication.

#### **5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- IaC uses scripts to automate infrastructure deployment.
- Enhances security by eliminating manual configuration errors.
- Immutable infrastructure reduces risks by replacing old systems with new ones.
