### Notes for Understanding

#### **APIs and Microservices**
- APIs let applications talk to each other; they act as messengers between systems.
- Microservices are small, independent services interacting through APIs.
- Secure APIs by using service meshes, enforcing coding standards, and restricting HTTP methods.

#### **Containers and Orchestration**
- Containers are lightweight environments running specific tasks efficiently.
- Orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage large numbers of containers.
- Security includes avoiding running containers as root, securing registries, and monitoring resources.

#### **Serverless Computing**
- Runs code only when needed, reducing attack surfaces.
- Use API gateways for authentication, authorization, and rate-limiting.
- Ensure each serverless application is isolated to prevent breaches.

#### **Infrastructure as Code**
- Automates deployment with scripts, ensuring consistency.
- Immutable infrastructure replaces old systems instead of patching them, reducing risks.

#### **DevSecOps**
- Security is integrated into the development pipeline.
- Use automated tools to check for vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices.
